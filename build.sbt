// The simplest possible sbt build file is just one line:

scalaVersion := "2.12.4"
// That is, to create a valid sbt build, all you've got to do is define the
// version of Scala you'd like your project to use.

// ============================================================================

// Lines like the above defining `scalaVersion` are called "settings" Settings
// are key/value pairs. In the case of `scalaVersion`, the key is "scalaVersion"
// and the value is "2.12.4"

// It's possible to define many kinds of settings, such as:

name := "Scala Practice"
organization := "burythehammer"
version := "0.1"

// Note, it's not required for you to define these three settings. These are
// mostly only necessary if you intend to publish your library's binaries on a
// place like Sonatype or Bintray.


// Want to use a published library in your project?
// You can define other libraries as dependencies in your build like this:
libraryDependencies += "org.scalactic" %% "scalactic" % "3.0.5"
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.0.5" % "test"
